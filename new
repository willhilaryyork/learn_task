描述

Nette Documentation doesn't everything but even that you can find there so many things.

I want from you to continue reading following items and testing it in code.

https://doc.nette.org/en/2.3/php-language-enhancements
https://doc.nette.org/en/2.3/routing
https://doc.nette.org/en/2.3/access-control
https://doc.nette.org/en/2.3/http-request-response

When you finish all of these earlier, try to make Getting Started again. Now you have much more knowledge about Nette Framework you should understand very well and see things what you didn't see before.
